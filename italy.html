            <h1><b>INSTRUCTIONS</b></h1>
           <p>
STEP 1
Make the pizza dough: Follow the Best Pizza Dough recipe to prepare the dough. (This takes about 15 minutes to make and 45 minutes to rest.)

STEP 2             
Place a pizza stone in the oven and preheat to 500°F. OR preheat your pizza oven (here’s the pizza oven we use).
      
STEP3
Make the pizza sauce: Make the 5 Minute Pizza Sauce.
     
STEP4
Prepare the cheese: If using fresh mozzarella cheese, slice it into ¼ inch thick pieces (see the photo). If it’s incredibly watery fresh mozzarella (all brands vary), you may want to let it sit on a paper towel to remove moisture for about 15 minutes then dab the mozzarella with the paper towel to remove any additional moisture.
     
STEP5
Bake the pizza: When the oven is ready, dust a pizza peel with cornmeal or semolina flour. (If you don’t have a pizza peel, you can use a rimless baking sheet or the back of a rimmed baking sheet. But a pizza peel is well worth the investment!) Stretch the dough into a circle; see How to Stretch Pizza Dough for instructions. Then gently place the dough onto the pizza peel. 
     
STEP6
Spread the pizza sauce over the dough using the back of a spoon to create a thin layer. Add the mozzarella cheese. Top with a few pinches of kosher salt.
     
STEP7
Use the pizza peel to carefully transfer the pizza onto the preheated pizza stone. Bake the pizza until the cheese and crust are nicely browned, about 5 to 7 minutes in the oven (or 1 minute in a pizza oven).
     
STEP8
Dollop with the basil pesto. Slice into pieces and serve immediately.

        <h2>Pasta</h2>
        <p>Pasta is an essential part of Italian cuisine, offering a rich variety with different pasta types, sauces, and ingredients.</p>

        <div class="recipe-content" id="recipe2">
            <h1><b>INSTRUCTIONS</b></h1>
           <p>
STEP 1
Put a large saucepan on a medium heat and add 1 tbsp olive oil.

STEP 2             
Add 4 finely chopped bacon rashers and fry for 10 mins until golden and crisp.
      
STEP3
Reduce the heat and add the 2 onions, 2 carrots, 2 celery sticks, 2 garlic cloves and the leaves from 2-3 sprigs rosemary, all finely chopped, then fry for 10 mins. Stir the veg often until it softens.
     
STEP4
Increase the heat to medium-high, add 500g beef mince and cook stirring for 3-4 mins until the meat is browned all over.
     
STEP5
Add 2 tins plum tomatoes, the finely chopped leaves from ¾ small pack basil, 1 tsp dried oregano, 2 bay leaves, 2 tbsp tomato purée, 1 beef stock cube, 1 deseeded and finely chopped red chilli (if using), 125ml red wine and 6 halved cherry tomatoes. Stir with a wooden spoon, breaking up the plum tomatoes.
     
STEP6
Bring to the boil, reduce to a gentle simmer and cover with a lid. Cook for 1 hr 15 mins stirring occasionally, until you have a rich, thick sauce.
     
STEP7
Add the 75g grated parmesan, check the seasoning and stir.
     
STEP8
When the bolognese is nearly finished, cook 400g spaghetti following the pack instructions.
     
STEP9
Drain the spaghetti and either stir into the bolognese sauce, or serve the sauce on top. Serve with more grated parmesan, the remaining basil leaves and crusty bread, if you like.

    <div class="recipe" id="risotto">
        <img src="images/risotto.jpg" alt="Risotto">
        <h2>Risotto</h2>
        <p>Risotto is a Northern Italian dish, known for its creamy rice cooked with chicken broth, wine, onions, and cheese.</p>
        <button class="recipe-button" onclick="showRecipe('recipe3')">Show Recipe</button>
        <div class="recipe-content" id="recipe3">
            <h1><b>INSTRUCTIONS</b></h1>
           <p>
STEP 1
Start off with a ‘soffritto‘ and melt the butter in a saucepan along with finely chopped onion, frying for about five minutes or until golden.

STEP 2             
Next, add the arborio rice and stir thoroughly until it’s fully coated in the butter. Fry for approximately 2-3 minutes

STEP3
Add the white wine and mix until it has combined with the rice.
     
STEP4
Then pour 1/2 pint of the stock into the saucepan and bring to the boil. Lower the heat and leave to simmer, allowing time for the liquids to be absorbed by the rice. During this time you should be stirring frequently.
     
STEP5
Here comes the tricky part! Continue adding 1/2 a pint of stock at a time. Each time repeat the process of mixing, allowing the liquid to be fully absorbed and then (and only then) adding more. If the stock is added in one go it won’t be absorbed properly. So remember patience is key here. After all, Rome wasn’t built in a day.
     
STEP6
After about 20 minutes this process should be complete and the rice should be creamy yet al dente.
     
STEP7
The next part is called the ‘mantecatura‘. Take the risotto off the heat and stir a tablespoon of butter in thoroughly. This is what really sets Italian risotto apart and gives it that creamy texture.
     
STEP8
Optional: if you want a cheesy risotto add parmesan and some Bel Paese chopped into small squares and fold both cheeses into the rice at the mantecatura stage. Do this for about 2 minutes until the cheeses have melted through.
     
STEP9
Finally, add the oregano and salt and pepper to taste. Serve your risotto with a freshly made salad, or a glass of red wine, or both!

        <h2>Osso Buco</h2>
        <p>Osso Buco is a Milanese dish featuring braised veal shanks with onions, carrots, celery, white wine, and tomatoes.</p>

            <h1><b>INSTRUCTIONS</b></h1>
            <p>
 STEP 1
 Dust the veal shanks lightly with flour.
 
 STEP 2             
 Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium to medium-high heat. Add the veal, and cook until browned on the outside. Remove to a bowl, and keep warm.
 
 STEP3
 Add two cloves of crushed garlic and onion to the skillet; cook and stir until onion is tender.
      
 STEP4
 Return the veal to the pan and mix in the carrot and wine. Simmer for 10 minutes.
      
 STEP5
 Pour in the tomatoes and beef stock, and season with salt and pepper.
      
 STEP6
 Cover, and simmer over low heat for 1 1/2 hours, basting the veal every 15 minutes or so. The meat should be tender, but not falling off the bone.
