        <h2>History of French Cuisine</h2>
        <p>French cuisine is a style of cooking developed by people of French origin or by the French. French cuisine consists of cooking traditions and practices from France. French cuisine has developed over the centuries, influenced by many cultures around Spain, Italy, Switzerland, Germany and Belgium. Cheese and wine are an important part of French cuisine. French cuisine has contributed significantly to Western cuisine.</p>
        <p>French food culture criteria are widely used in equine cookery schools and culinary education. In November 2010, French gastronomy was added to the lists of the world's "intangible cultural heritage" by UNESCO. There are French dishes that today are recognised as part of French national cuisine. A meal usually consists of hors d'oeuvre or starter, main course, cheese or dessert, sometimes salad served before cheese or dessert.</p>

    <h2>Éclair</h2>
    <p>One of the very few things known about eclairs is that they originated in France in the late 19th century. Many food historians suggest that éclairs were first made by Marie-Antoine Carême, the famous pastry cook of the French royal family.

        "Éclair" means a burst of lightning in French. It got its name from the fact that it is easily eaten in one bite.
